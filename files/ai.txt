The U.S. stock market is reacting to a combination of economic data, geopolitical tensions, and corporate earnings reports:

1. **Tariff Deadlines**: Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico are expected to be announced next week, with markets pricing in a potential 40% increase in futures for U.S.-Canada trade.

2. **Stock Market Performance**:
   - The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is down 0.53%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) trailing behind at -0.77%.
   - Tech-heavy sectors, including Apple (AAPL) and NVIDIA (NVDA), are underperforming (-1.53% and -2.87% respectively).

3. **Earnings Reports**:
   - Meta Platforms (META) is trading lower after missing earnings expectations, with a Street Price of $158.71 versus a current tick price of $60.23.
   - Energy-focused companies like Olin (OLN) and natural gas imports (GAS) are also seeing short-term declines.

4. **Inflation Data**:
   - December PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) is mixed, with core inflation meeting expectations but showing lag in MM (Month-to-Month).

5. **Supply Chain Issues**: 
   - Companies like Olin and Walgreens Boots Alliance are facing supply chain disruptions affecting their Q4 results.
   - Energy prices remain stable, providing some stabilization amid inflation concerns.

6. **Global Trade**: The U.S.-Canada trade deal is viewed as critical for avoiding a trade war, with both sides preparing to sign the agreement if Trump's deadline is met.

7. **Bond Markets**: U.S. Treasuries are outperforming due to cautious Fed monetary policy and optimism about inflation data, which aligns with the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

8. **Energy Exports**:
   - Oil from Saudi Arabia (SHEL) sees strength amid geopolitical tensions.
   - Natural gas imports (GAS) show resilience despite weaker U.S. demand reports.

Overall, markets are balancing risks tied to inflation, tariffs, and corporate earnings with potential stabilization in energy prices and supply chain dynamics.
